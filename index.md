# Data Science Projects Portfolio

For my data science journey, I decided to practice various types of projects on my own by mainly using **RStudio**. Also, I occasionally utilize other data analytics tools such as Tableau, GIS software, and SQL depending on the purpose/needs of each project.

#### There are four major categories of my data science projects:

*   Pre-Processing: Data Preparation & Cleaning.
*   Data Visualization.
*   Exploratory Data Analysis.
*   Machine Learning & AI Modelling.

---
### Project A. Pre-Processing: Data Preparation & Cleaning

In terms of my project time management, I spend more than 70% of the total solely by searching for the data, cleaning, and manipulating the datasets as part of my project preparation. During this time, I try to apply different perspectives and critical thinkings by brainstorming on _"what specific problems I should tackle down with the given data"_ and _"how I can extract actionable insights from the data"_.  


### Project B. Data Visualization Projects 


I would like to start off with organizing a simple "Movie Rating" dataset by utilizing a _web-scraping_ tool, **"SelectorGadget"**.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.


### Project C. Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

  
[City-Level Data Analysis: Low Fertility Rate in the Republic of Korea](https://github.com/byeonghyeonSo/byeonghyeonSo.github.io/blob/5ea971254ab9db2f8606f755fbea390fbb006a09/Final-Project.html).

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.


### Project D. Machine Learning Project

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
